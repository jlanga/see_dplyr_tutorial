This is a small tutorial of data processing with R with the `dplyr` and `tidyr` packages.

It is based on Kevin Markham's [Introduction to dplyr for Faster Data Manipulation in R](https://rpubs.com/justmarkham/dplyr-tutorial).

This repo contains a Rpub presentation, (R)Markdown code, some images and a GTF dataset representing the assembled RNA transcripts from a Zebrafish liver.
